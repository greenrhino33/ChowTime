ChowTime
========

A food mod. It adds dynamically loaded items, tiered crops, TurtlePi's and ice cream, and other stuffs.
 
To start off, find a TurtlePi. (Pink and Green, too cute to miss)
Right click on the TurtlePi with Wheat Seeds to get random ChowTime seeds.
Only certain seeds can be planted at first, harvest things to level up to better crops.

TurtlePi's are attracted to and are mated with strawberries.

Ice Cream Maker
Ice/Snow in lower left slot, fruit and milk, then get ice cream :D

Juicer
Place fruit in the slot, wait, and get juice. Juice + Sugar = Jam

Fermenter
(Nothing really to use this for yet)
